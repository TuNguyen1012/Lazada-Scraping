## Introduction and Objective

This project aims to learn how to scrape a dataset of product information from Lazada (an e-commerce platform) using Selenium, clean that dataset, and use it to extract more useful information.

Furthermore, I'll create a Tableau dashboard for our product.

There are two parts to the project: Data Scraping and Tableau dashboards. If you want to see some visualizations without concern with the technical details, you can jump straight to the dashboard and report.

The store we scraped today is Guardian - a retailer of health and beauty products.

## Tableau Dashboard & Report:
